# Plunker example mirror 

Plnkr.co can not be accessed SSL-encryped.
Therefore it is not possible to embed plunker examples on and SSL-excryped page.
As workaround I mirror the the whole examples to a github page and replaces all the relevant urls.

This repository contains the shell script for mirroring the page and hopefully all relevant information to make this workaround useful to others.

## Configuration

The base path for your mirror MUST be configured before using the mirror script.
Simply copy the sample file `config.sample.sh `:

    cp config.sample.sh config.sh

Edit the BASE_PATH in `config.sh`:

    # PATH FOR URL REPLACEMENTS
    BASE_PATH="<my-github-page-base-path>/"

## Usage

To mirror a plunker example just run the script `mirror-plunker-preview.sh` with the plunker id as single parameter.

     ./mirror-plunker-preview.sh mNPRyvaBQxBrlElCs7UQ

The results looks like this.

* Original plunker URL: [http://embed.plnkr.co/mNPRyvaBQxBrlElCs7UQ/preview](http://embed.plnkr.co/mNPRyvaBQxBrlElCs7UQ/preview )
* New mirrored URL: [https://tilmanpotthof.github.io/plunker-preview-mirror/embed.plnkr.co/mNPRyvaBQxBrlElCs7UQ/preview.html#!//preview](https://tilmanpotthof.github.io/plunker-preview-mirror/embed.plnkr.co/mNPRyvaBQxBrlElCs7UQ/preview.html#!//preview)

## Limitations

Resources that are not referenced in the DOM are not mirrored by `wget` and must be added manually to the run folder.

    echo '{"users":[]}' > run.plnkr.co/plunks/<plunker-id>/users.json
